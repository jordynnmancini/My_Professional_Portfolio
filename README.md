# Professional Portfolio (part 2)

## The Task 
The goal for the homework this week was to create an updated Portfolio to showcase our work. This is an upgraded version from our second homework assignment, and it includes our most recently finished group project. We have also been asked to submit an updated GitHub profile, an updated resume, and an updated LinkedIn profile. 

## The Process
Inspired by one of the group project demonstrations from the group, I used Hyperspace - a responsive site template designed by HTML5 UP & released under the Creative Commons (license included). I took the default template and added my own customization - including new colors & new fonts. This template comes with some CSS/SCSS & some Javascript. I then added my own custom CSS & HTML - along with updated links to some of my favorite GitHub Repositiories, my GitHub Profile, my LinkedIn, and my Resume.
